# Transmorph_2D_translation
2D translation-only implementation of Transmorph

This is a modified version of the original [TransMorph](https://github.com/junyuchen245/TransMorph_Transformer_for_Medical_Image_Registration) model, which supports Non-linear registration.

The registration head of the model is modified with linear layers to output (x,y) translation value for the given image pair.
Synthetic data is generated by adding a shift to the original images.
